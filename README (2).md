- I really enjoy the process of joint debugging!

- This time, we design a C&S system with TCP connection. There are still more challenges waiting for us.

- The client code is in `myGobangDay3HEURISTIC` with comprehensible comments.

- If there is something wrong in my code, please contact me, thanks! QQ:1473739278

- Although the process is not very smooth, when we can finally play game with our own system, all the pain is fogotten.

- For Linux server: the system temporarily only supports two clients connect at almost the same time, or you will fail to connect. However, the system will be improved and finally be perfect(we hope so hhh).

- The src of server includes `server.c` `serv_define.h` `serv_functions` three files

- If you are interested in our project, or find any bugs with our code, please email to me. Email: fth_wzk@foxmail.com. Thanks!
